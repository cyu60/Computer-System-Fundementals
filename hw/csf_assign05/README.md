//magarw13 - Mehul Agarwal
//cyu60 - Chinat Yu

We spend quite a bit of time understanding the concepts and questions together. 
Chinat focused more on the implementation of the Calculator and the documentations for the implementations
Mehul focused more on the server and network aspects of the calculator, as well as the futher test files
Overall, we have a really productive time learning and working with each other.
