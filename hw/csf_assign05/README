//magarw13 - Mehul Agarwal
//cyu60 - Chinat Yu

We spend quite a bit of time understanding the concepts and questions together. 
We both worked together on the implementation of the calculator and the server. Chinat focused more on the calculator. On the other hand, Mehul focused nmore on the server. Both helped each other in debugging the programs. 
This assignment was easier than the previous ones so didn't take as long. 
Overall, we have a really productive time learning and working with each other.
