//magarw13 - Mehul Agarwal
//cyu60 - Chinat Yu

We spend quite a bit of time understanding the concepts and questions together. 
We both worked together on the implementation of the multi-thread calculator. Chinat focused more on ensuring the syncronization of variables. Mehul focused more on the worker function. Both helped each other in debugging the programs. 
Overall, we have a really productive time learning and working with each other.
