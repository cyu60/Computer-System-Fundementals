    - Started working on the driver program
    - Can parse plugins into array
    - list functions is working well
    - instructions can be printed
    - Need to work on exec and handling left
    - Maybe we should create a seperate header file??

- - [[April 3rd, 2021]]
    - Finished coding up the driver
    - Need to test out for different `plugins`
    - Need to test out for alternative `plugin routes`
    - Need to tidy up the code style? -- refactor to make main smaller
        - Consider having separate header and cpp files
