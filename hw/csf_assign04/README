    - Started working on the driver program
    - Can parse plugins into array
    - list functions is working well
    - instructions can be printed
    - Need to work on exec and handling left
    - Maybe we should create a seperate header file??

- - [[April 3rd, 2021]]
- Finished coding up the driver
- Need to test out for different `plugins`
    - Plugins can be recognized -- name and description can be generated
    - Tested out the mirror files, `mirrorh` truncates the file
- Need to tidy up the code style? -- refactor to make main smaller
    - Consider having separate header and cpp files
    - [601.229 (S21): CSF coding style guidelines (jhucsf.github.io)](https://jhucsf.github.io/spring2021/assign/style.html)
    - 30-50 non-comment lines of code: it __might__ be reasonable for one or two functions in your program to be this long (perhaps your main function), but deductions for over-complexity are a possibility
    - More than 50 non-comment lines of code: expect a style deduction
